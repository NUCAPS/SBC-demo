This very short tutorial will show the basic steps to accessing GOES-16 data on AWS and make an image of the [Sandwich RGB](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/goes/documents/SandwichProduct.pdf)!

This demo will cover:

* Import relevant packages
* Search cloud repositories for the data we want
* Import the data into memory
* Make a plot of the sandwich product
